# Run
Let's run some command lines on SublimeText 3

## Todo
* Streaming output (just because it look way better)
* Colors (life is better with colors)
* Completion (don't even know if that's possible)
* Commands History (because our brain is not that good)
* Windows and Linux support (we must make sure everyone can get it)
